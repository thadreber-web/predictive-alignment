# Predictive Alignment Research Log

## 2026-02-27 — Phase 1 Build & First Experiment

### What was built
- Complete Phase 1 codebase implementing Asabuki & Clopath (2025) predictive alignment
- Core files: `src/network.py`, `src/targets.py`, `src/instrumentation.py`, `src/utils.py`
- 7 experiment scripts (`experiments/01-07`)
- Running in stiefel-unsloth container on DGX Spark (GB10 GPU)

### Experiment 01: Sine wave — debugging journey

**Goal:** Train N=500 network to autonomously generate a sine wave (period=600ms, amplitude=1.5).

#### v1 — First attempt (FAILED)
- Config: dt=0.1ms, eta_w=1e-3, eta_m=1e-4, train=30s
- Bug: `tqdm` argument `miniinterval` → should be `mininterval`. Fixed across all files.
- Result: Lyapunov went from 6.6 → 47.3 (MORE chaotic after training!)
- Training error decreased (readout w learned) but M destabilized the network
- Autonomous generation: RMSE=1.31, output at wrong frequency
- Diagnosis: Too many timesteps accumulating M updates

#### v2 — Lower eta_m (IMPROVED but still broken)
- Config: dt=0.1ms, eta_m=1e-5, train=60s
- Result: Lyapunov 6.6 → 40.4, test RMSE=0.47
- Better but Lyapunov still going UP — M still destabilizing

#### v3 — dt-scaled learning (NO CHANGE)
- Added `dt` multiplier to learning updates in network.py
- Compensated with higher base rates (eta_w=1e-2, eta_m=1e-3)
- Result: Identical to v1 — effective rates were the same
- Lesson: scaling by dt + increasing base rate = no net change

#### Key insight: Paper uses dt=1ms, not 0.1ms!
- Checked actual paper (bioRxiv preprint): **dt = 1ms** with tau=10ms
- phase_1.md said dt=0.1ms but the paper uses 1ms
- This means 10x fewer timesteps per second of simulated time
- dt/tau = 0.1 (not 0.01) — larger integration steps

#### v4 — dt=1ms, original rates (PARTIAL)
- Config: dt=1ms, eta_w=1e-3, eta_m=1e-4, train=60s
- Result: Lyapunov 1.02 → 3.27, error 0.044 → 0.013, RMSE=0.78
- Error still decreasing at end of training — needed more time

#### v5 — dt=1ms, higher eta_m, longer training (SUCCESS)
- Config: dt=1ms, eta_w=1e-3, eta_m=1e-3, train=300s (500 periods)
- Result:
  - Lyapunov: 1.02 → 3.57
  - Error: 0.020 → **0.00089** (monotonic decrease)
  - Test RMSE: **0.027** (excellent match)
  - Autonomous generation: nearly perfect sine wave for full 10s test
- The network learned to be a sine wave oscillator

### Validated parameters for Phase 1
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| dt | 1.0 ms | Matches paper (NOT 0.1ms from phase_1.md) |
| tau | 10.0 ms | |
| eta_w | 1e-3 | Readout learning rate |
| eta_m | 1e-3 | Recurrent learning rate (higher than phase_1.md suggested) |
| alpha | 1.0 | |
| g | 1.2 | |
| N | 500 | |
| Training | 300s+ | Need 500+ periods for convergence |

### Open questions
1. Lyapunov still goes UP (1.0 → 3.6) even in the successful run. Paper claims it should go negative. Is there a remaining implementation difference, or does the Lyapunov estimator need fixing?
2. The weight initialization std formula may differ from the paper (I use g/sqrt(pN), paper might use sqrt(g/N)). Need to check impact.
3. How will these parameters transfer to Lorenz (15,000s training) and RSG (200k trials)?

### Next steps
- Run experiments 02-07 with validated parameters
- Investigate Lyapunov discrepancy
- Document results for each experiment
